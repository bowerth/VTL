# VTL E&E

An engine and editor for the 
[Validation and Transformation Language](https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5096), 
written in Java, Javascript and R.

## Usage and documentation

Usage info, documentation and examples are available at the
[project site](http://vpinna80.github.io/VTL/).

## Contributing to the project

All contributions are welcome!

Please take a moment to read the [Guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Build information

A complete description of the project modules and the build process will be aailable soon.

To build this project, you will need:

* A Windows or Linux machine;

> Building on a MacOS machine should be possible by now but **it is untested**.

* JDK 8;
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.6.3;
* [GNU R](https://www.r-project.org/) 3.5.3;
* Configured internet connection (to download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

To build the project, launch the command:

    mvn [-P with-r] [-Dsdmx.version=x.x.x] clean package


Each artifact will be generated inside the `target` folder of each module.

If you want to build the editor and the R package along the engine, activate the 
`with-r` maven profile; you may need to configure your internet connection in 
Maven. The R package, ready for installation in R (with install.packages), will 
be located there.

If you want to use a different version of the 
[SDMX connectors](https://github.com/amattioc/SDMX.git) dependency, change 
the relative property value. The current default version is 2.3.3. [Check 
here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/it.bancaditalia.oss/sdmx) the available maven releases.

## Project Status

The Project is an ongoing development effort at Bank of Italy, with the 
purpose of demonstrating the feasibility and usefulness of VTL in a real 
scenario, such as translating validation rules exchanged by entities 
operating in the ESCB. Thus,

> some VTL operators and statements offer only limited functionality,
and some have to be implemented yet.

The following map shows the current implementation status:
